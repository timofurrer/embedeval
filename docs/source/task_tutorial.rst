Task Implementation Tutorial
============================

Tasks are the heart pieces of embedeval.
They are used to evaluate Word Embeddings on their quality
with respect to certain measures given certain baselines.

The Task API can be found in detail in the :ref:`Task API <task_api>`
section of this documentation.

There exists two ways of creating a new Taks.
The most simplest one is to create one using the ``embedeval create-task`` command.
The other one is from scratch and can be seen as a reference for the details of a
Task Implementation.

A new Task from the CLI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following section describes how to create a new Task
using the ``embedeval`` command line interface.

Task from the built-in skeleton
-------------------------------

``embedeval`` comes with a built-in skeleton Task which can be used as
a base for a new Task:

.. code-block:: bash

   embedeval create-task word-similarity

This command will create a new Task called ``word-similarity``
based on the skeleton Task and placed in a Python module
called ``word_similarity.py`` in the current directory.

Often that's not the place the module should be placed,
thus with the ``--target-task-path`` option a target
directory for the new Task can be specified:

.. code-block:: bash

   embedeval create-task word-similarity --target-task-path tasks/

The skeleton doesn't provide much, therefore the new Task can be
based on another Task known to ``embedeval`` using
the ``--based-on`` option:

.. code-block:: bash

   embedeval create-task word-similarity --based-on odd-one-out

The above command will create the Task based on the ``embedeval``
``odd-one-out`` built-in Taks.

In case the Task should be created based on a non built-in Task
the ``--tasks-path`` option can be used:

.. code-block:: bash

   embedeval create-task word-similarity-v2 \
      --based-on word-similarity \
      --tasks-path tasks/ \


A new Task from scratch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following sections will guide through the steps which need
to be done to implement a Task and how to do an evaluation with them.

Step 1: Task Anatomy
--------------------

First we'll see how a Task is represented in code.

A Task is a subclass of the following Python Interface:

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/embedeval/task.py
   :pyobject: Task

Don't mind the ``__init__subclass__`` magic method as it's only used internally
to register the Tasks in the Task Registry.

Important is ``evaluate()`` method. that's the method used to implement
the evaluation algorithm of a Task.

Step 2: Define a Task
---------------------

The first thing to think about is the name of the Task.
The name is used to reference the Task from the command line
to use it for the evaluation.

This name can be used as the class name suffixed with ``Task``
and must be used as the value for the ``NAME`` class attribute:

.. testcode::

   from embedeval.task import Task


   class WordSimilarityTask(Task):
       """Compare two words in regards of how similar they are"""

       NAME = "word-similarity"

       def evaluate(self, embedding):
           ...

This Task can be implemented in an appropriatly named Python module
within the embedeval source code at: ``src/embedeval/tasks/``.
A good name module for this Task would be ``src/embedeval/tasks/word_similarity.py``.


Step 3: Implement Task Algorithm
--------------------------------

The most important step is to implement the evaluation algorithm
for the new Task.

The ``evaluate()`` method is the place for that.
It is given a ``WordEmbedding`` instance and should return an
evauation report as a human readable string:


.. testcode::

   import colorful as cf

   from embedeval.task import Task


   class WordSimilarityTask(Task):
       """Compare two words in regards of how similar they are"""

       NAME = "word-similarity"

       def evaluate(self, embedding):
           woman_vector = embedding.get_word_vector("woman")
           man_vector = embedding.get_word_vector("man")

           # TODO: ``cosine_similarity`` must be implemented
           similarity = cosine_similarity(woman_vector, man_vector)

           return f"""
               {cf.bold}The Task{cf.reset}:
                   How similar is the word woman to the word man?
               was {cf.underlined}successful{cf.reset}.
               The similarity was measured to be
                   {cf.bold}{similarity:.2}{cf.reset}
           """


Step 4: Run the Task
--------------------

Now that the evaluation algorithm is implemented we can run the Task
on a Word Embedding from the command line using ``embedeval``:

.. code-block:: bash

   embedeval embedding.vec -t word-similarity
