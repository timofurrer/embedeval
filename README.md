***

The *NLP Embeddings Evaluation Tool* is a command line tool to evaluate Natural Language Processing Embeddings
using custom intrinsic and extrinsic tasks.

# Installation

embedeval is available as `pip` package:

```bash
python -m pip install embedeval
```

NOTE: it might not be installable as of today using pip with PyPI.
However, installing from source will work. Use `.` instead of `embedeval` in the pip command.

# Getting started

Run the `word-analogy` Task on your Word Embedding:

```bash
embedeval embedding.vec -t word-analogy
```

Run the `word-analogy` and `word-similarity` Tasks on your Word Embedding:

```bash
embedeval embedding.vec -t word-analogy -t word-similarity
```
